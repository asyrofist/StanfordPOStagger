And the practice should n't be stopped  , he says 0 , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading . ''
 Also in New York , Israel Silverman , an insurance-company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think 0 it should be banned  .
There 's no culprit here .
The market is just becoming more efficient . ''
Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says 0 .
He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested  in a mutual fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund .
But `` I 'm a long-term investor , '' he says .
`` If you were a short-term investor , you might be more leery about program trading . ''
Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge .
`` If we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` Buy , ' '' he explains .
`` If you could get the rhythm of the program trading , you could take advantage of it . ''
What else can a small investor do ?
Scott Taccetta , a Chicago accountant , is going into money-market funds .
Mr. Taccetta says 0 he had just recouped the $ 5,000 0 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13 .
Now , he plans  to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990 .
In October , before the market dropped , Mrs. Arighi of Arnold , Calif. , moved  to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able  to withstand all this flim-flammery '' caused by program trading .
She believes that the only answer for individuals is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm . ''
Lucille Gorman , an 84-year-old Chicago housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts .
Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash  to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge .
`` My stocks are all blue chips , '' she says .
`` If the market goes down , I figure 0 it 's paper profits 0 I 'm losing .
On the other hand , if it goes way sky high , I always sell .
You do n't want  to get yourself too upset about these things .
Young 's Market Co. , a wholesaler of spirits , wines and other goods , said 0 it will merge with a new corporation formed by the Underwood family , which controls Young 's .
Under terms of the agreement , shareholders other than the Underwoods will receive $ 3,500 a share at closing , which is expected  in December .
The Underwood family said that holders of more than a majority of the stock of the company have approved the transaction by written consent .
Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories reported 0 they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100 ,  moving the materials closer to commercial use .
The scientists said 0 they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors  to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field .
The scientists said 0 they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit .
Their report appears in today 's issue of the journal Nature .
The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed  at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .
Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems  increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .
Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when  cooled  .
A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised  .
The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome  .
But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors , cautioned 0 Robert B. van Dover , one of the AT&T researchers .
He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals .
Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed  for commercial applications .
Mr. van Dover said 0 the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by  bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use .
Still , scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding , because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential .
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current-carrying capacity .
Mr. van Dover said 0 the crystal changes 0 his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from  lowering current-carrying capacity .
Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying  to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem .
Determining that may enable them to develop better ways 0 to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns .
The AT&T team also is trying  to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt-textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories .
The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .
William C. Walbrecher Jr. , an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank , was named  president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit , Fidelity Federal Bank .
The appointment takes effect Nov. 13 .
He succeeds James A. Taylor , who stepped down as chairman , president and chief executive in March for health reasons .
Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman .
Separately , Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 2.3 million , or 68 cents a share , versus net income of $ 5.3 million , or $ 1.61 a share , a year earlier .
The latest results include some unusual write-downs , which had an after-tax impact of $ 4.9 million .
Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition , which was terminated  on Sept. 27 , 1989 .
In addition , operating results were hit  by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading , Citadel shares closed yesterday at $ 45.75 , down 25 cents .

Although his team lost the World Series , San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes  to have a new home for them .
He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot 0 to help  build a replacement for Candlestick Park .
Small wonder , since he 's asking San Francisco taxpayers  to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium .
As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One , opponents say 0 the last thing 0 the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .
A stadium craze is sweeping the country .
It 's fueled  by the increasing profitability of major-league teams .
Something like one-third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg .
Most boosters claim 0 the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that .
He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
Stadiums tend  to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it .
Voters generally agree when they are given  a chance to decide if they want  to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium .
San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago .
Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the Chamber of Commerce , the major media -- and spent $ 100,000 on promotion .
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % .
In San Francisco , its backers concede 0 the ballpark is at best running even in the polls .
George Christopher , the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s , wo n't endorse the new ballpark .
He says 0 he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed 0 they needed 10,000 parking spaces .
Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks 0 backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters .
Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built  .
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it .
Several years ago he gave up  trying  to persuade Miami  to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .
He did n't see why the taxpayers should help  build something 0 he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
`` This stadium shows that anything 0 government can do , we can do  better , '' Mr. Robbie says .
But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped  build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
`` The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
`` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used  or its economics . ''
An Egyptian Pharaoh could n't have justified his pyramids any better .
But civilization has moved forward since then .
Today taxpayers get  to vote , most of the time , on whether they want  to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5 % to # 89.7 million -LRB- $ 141.9 million -RRB- , or 16 pence a share , from # 94.8 million -LRB- $ 149.9 million -RRB- , or 17.3 pence a share .
The British paper , packaging and publishing concern , said 0 profit from continuing lines fell 10 % to # 118 million from # 130.6 million .
While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period , there was a one-time gain of # 18 million in the 1988 period .
And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations , last year they contributed # 34 million , before tax .
Pretax profit fell 3.7 % to # 128 million from # 133 million and was below analysts ' expectations of # 130 million to # 135 million , but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London .
Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence , up 15 % from 4 pence a year earlier .
Sales fell 20 % to # 722 million .
Earnings were hurt  by disposal of operations in its restructuring , Reed said 0 .
Wall Street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
The reason : Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes .
The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. , by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , coupled with a Moody 's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community this week .
With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling  to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably .
Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which they sell  to finance their daily operations .
The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered  soon , a move that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms .
Shearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co .
`` Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president .
`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ''
Standard & Poor 's Corp. says 0 First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely  to have difficulty  shoring up their credit standing in months ahead .
What worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .
That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured  to be sold  quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .
`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says 0 Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston .
`` Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's .
Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it 0 to go around . ''
In addition , he says , the buy-out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely  to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks .
In a leveraged buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid  with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets .
In a recent report , Moody 's said 0 it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . ''
It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by  taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ''
Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit .
The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units .
In addition , a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co . was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn  .
`` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 's said .
`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . ''
CS First Boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank .
Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business .
But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash .
In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated  , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill .
Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P .
A Shearson spokesman said 0 the firm is n't worried .
`` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said .
`` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained  . ''
Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .
The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market .
The firm also has been hit  with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal .
Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business ,  cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .
Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years .
The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say 0 .
Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
`` We 're well positioned  with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said 0 .
`` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months .
Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after  experiencing recent heart problems .
Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co .
But he is best known  in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. .
Under the so-called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle .
The concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
It was later applied to other new-car programs , including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar .
Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has `` helped  to change the world 's perception of American-made cars . ''
Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years ,  holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions .
The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused  to hear an appeal from a case that says 0 corporate defendants must pay damages even after  proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm .
We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish  to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt  .
But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum 0 this country has 0 to debate risk , technology and innovation .
Too often now , a single court decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases .
From the 1940s until 1971 , some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES -RRB-  to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness .
The drug was approved  by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed  by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels .
In the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users .
The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used .
Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided  to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable .
Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed  against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales .
This has some logic .
Drug makers should n't be able  to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used  .
But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope .
Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties .
The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove 0 Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages .
But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held  liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California .
Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants .
The big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited  to DES or to drugs .
The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine .
The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction  to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs .
The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs ,  citing the huge , hidden social costs .
`` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said .
The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market .
This raises the key issue : What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?
We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means 0 the drugs wo n't be available to anyone .
As liability expert Peter Huber tells us , after the Hymowitz case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time 0 to sell that company 's stock short . ''
We also know that the tort system is a lousy way 0 to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way .
DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken  out of the courts .
Congress could create a compensation program 0 to help such victims while  protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs .
But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation .
Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation 0 to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass .
We have no doubt 0 this is one reason 0 judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing  to trash the law in the DES cases .
They must figure that justice has  to get done  by somebody , but know 0 it wo n't be done  by Congress .
Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership , an investment firm , completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co. 's Caldor discount chain for $ 500 million plus the assumption of $ 52 million in debt .
Caldor , based in Norwalk , Conn. , operates 118 stores in the Northeast ; it reported revenue of $ 1.6 billion last year .
May Stores , St. Louis , runs such well-known department stores as Lord & Taylor .
N.V . DSM said 0 net income in the third quarter jumped 63 % as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program .
The Dutch chemical group said 0 net income gained to 235 million guilders -LRB- $ 113.2 million -RRB- , or 6.70 guilders a share , from 144 million guilders , or 4.10 guilders a share , a year ago .
The 32 % state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter , mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations .
The charges were offset  in part by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division .
Last year , DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions .
The earnings growth also was fueled  by the company 's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders .
Also , substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth , the company added 0 .
Sales , however , were little changed  at 2.46 billion guilders , compared with 2.42 billion guilders .
Allergan Inc. said 0 it received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens , the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery .
The len 's foldability enables it to be inserted  in smaller incisions than are now possible for cataract surgery , the eye care and skin care concern said 0 .
Cataracts refer to a clouding of the eye 's natural lens .
A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday  to talk about the U.S. 's intention to send some $ 100 million in food aid to Poland , with more 0 to come from the EC .
The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland 's own farmers .
Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt .
However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers .
The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness .
It should be constantly stressed that Poland 's farmers mostly need a real market for their products .
Elco Industries Inc. said 0 it expects net income in the year ending June 30 , 1990 , to fall below a recent analyst 's estimate of $ 1.65 a share .
The Rockford , Ill. , maker of fasteners also said 0 it expects  to post sales in the current fiscal year that are `` slightly above '' fiscal 1989 sales of $ 155 million .
The company said 0 its industrial unit continues  to face margin pressures and lower demand .
In fiscal 1989 , Elco earned $ 7.8 million , or $ 1.65 a share .
The company 's stock fell $ 1.125 to $ 13.625 in over-the-counter trading yesterday .
Oshkosh Truck Corp. , Oshkosh , Wis. , estimated 0 earnings for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 50 % to 75 % below the year-earlier $ 4.5 million , or 51 cents a share .
The truck maker said 0 the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year .
In fiscal 1988 , the company earned $ 17.3 million , or $ 1.92 a share , on revenue of $ 352.9 million .
Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division , a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations .
The company said 0 it is in the process of phasing out John Deere , its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis .
In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory , the company said 0 a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built  0 to carry it through the transition period .

Speculation , on the other hand , sparked buying in certain incentive-backed issues , though rumors underlying such shares eventually proved untrue .
The development , traders said 0 , showed that there is more than ample liquidity available for investment despite the market 's recent directionless trend .
Dealers led the market Wednesday by  actively trading for their own accounts , observers said 0 .
Institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar .

Volume in the second section was estimated  at 18 million shares , up from 14 million Tuesday .
Akio Yamamoto , managing director of Nomura Investment Trust Management , said that if the U.S. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5 % , institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying .
Tokyu Group , Mitsubishi Estate and Bridgestone\/Firestone , which advanced Tuesday , declined on profit-taking .

It ended the day up 80 yen -LRB- 56 cents -RRB- to 1,880 yen -LRB- $ 13.15 -RRB- .
Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency , investor interest was directed  toward oil and mining shares , which traders called a `` defensive '' action frequently taken when the dollar is expected  to fall or during times of inflation .

London share prices were bolstered  largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for London 's blue-chip stocks .
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 17.5 points higher at 2160.1 .
It rose largely throughout the session after  posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading .
The index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2 , which was posted  within the last half-hour of trading .
Dealers said 0 most investor interest was focused  on defensive blue-chip stocks , particularly those with limited U.K. exposure .
Also , several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers .

Jaguar , a U.K. luxury auto maker being pursued by Ford Motor and General Motors , gained 10 pence -LRB- 16 cents -RRB- a share  to close at 879 pence -LRB- $ 13.90 -RRB- .
It shed about 7 pence , however , after dealers said 0 the market was disappointed that Ford did n't move  to tender a bid for control of the company .
Dealers said 0 the U.K. government 's decision Tuesday to waive its protective `` golden share '' in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two U.S. auto giants .
But the waiver also was seen  as a signal that Ford , a major U.K. auto industry employer , was able  to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of Jaguar .
Dealers said 0 that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by Ford .
B.A.T Industries , which is being pursued  by Sir James Goldsmith 's Hoylake Investments , rose 9 to 753 on speculation that Hoylake will sweeten its bid , dealers said 0 .
Like Jaguar , B.A.T also eased off its highs in afternoon dealings .
Reed International , a U.K. publishing group , gained 15 to 397 despite reporting a 3.7 % drop in interim pretax profit .
Analysts said 0 the fall in pretax profit was due to the group 's recent restructuring and sale of peripheral units , and that its remaining businesses are performing well .
Dealers said 0 the market agreed .
Stocks boosted by market-makers shopping to cover book requirements in FT-SE 100 shares included Carlton Communications , which climbed 32 to 778 .

Criminal charges were filed  against Diceon Electronics Inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its Chatsworth , Calif. , facility .
The Los Angeles County district attorney 's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine , Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid , caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system , and stored hazardous materials in leaky , unlabeled or open-top containers .
Named  as defendants were Roland Matthews , president , and Peter Jonas , executive vice president and chief financial officer , as well as a former plant manager .
The company said 0 local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to `` routine inspection '' in August .
`` The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court . ''
Arraignments are scheduled  for Nov. 14 .
Consumer confidence stayed strong in October , despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market .
`` The sharp stock market decline in late October appears  to have had little or no effect on consumers , '' said Fabian Linden , executive director of the Conference Board 's consumer research center .
`` Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event . ''
The nonprofit , industry-supported group said 0 its Consumer Confidence Index was 116.4 in October ,  barely changed  from a revised 116.3 in September .
The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7 .
It uses a base of 100 in 1985 .
In October , more people said that present business conditions were `` good '' than in September .
An equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good .
And 19.6 % of consumers contacted believed 0 business conditions will improve in the coming six months , compared with 18.3 % in September .
Also , more people said 0 conditions will worsen in the period .
-LRB- Fewer said 0 conditions wo n't change . -RRB-
In October 1988 , 21.1 % said 0 business conditions would improve .
In October 1989 , 16.9 % said 0 more jobs will be created  in the coming six months , compared with 17.4 % in September and 18.6 % in October 1988 .
Only 26.8 % in October , compared with 28.5 % in September and 26.8 % in October 1988 , said 0 income would increase .
`` The sustained level of confidence can be attributed  to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer 's day-to-day economic life , '' said Mr. Linden .
`` Unemployment continues at a relatively low level , providing a sense of job security , and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong . ''
The consumer confidence survey ,  covering 5,000 U.S. households , is conducted  in the first two weeks of each month for the Conference Board by National Family Opinion Inc. , a Toledo , Ohio , market researcher .
Buying plans were mixed in October , with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying 0 they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months .
In October , 6.7 % of respondents said 0 they will buy a car , easing from September when 8.1 % anticipated a purchase .
In October 1988 , 7.3 % said 0 they would buy a car .
Home purchase plans increased to 3.3 % from 3.1 % in the two recent months .
In October 1988 , 3.7 % said 0 they would buy a house .
In 1989 , home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9 % to 3.7 % of respondents .
In October , 30.6 % said 0 they will buy appliances in the coming six months , compared with 27.4 % in September and 26.5 % in October 1988 .
Despite a deluge of economic news , the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp. 's huge debt offering .
`` There were so many economic reports but the market did n't care about any of them , '' said Kathleen Camilli , a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
`` So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets , corporate and mortgages in particular , '' she said .
IBM , the giant computer maker , offered $ 750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced  to yield 8.47 % , or about 1\/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds .
The size of IBM 's issue was increased  from an originally planned $ 500 million as money managers and investors scrambled  to buy the bonds .
In the investment-grade corporate market , `` it 's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features , '' said 0 James Ednie , a Drexel industrial bond trader .
Money managers ranked IBM 's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-A credit are infrequent .
Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said 0 the debentures were snapped by up  pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors .
In the Treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy .
`` Whether you thought 0 the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said Charles Lieberman , a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .
The government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower .
Both indicators were viewed  as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all .
A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy .
In a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed 's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14. , the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks .
Among other things , the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries .
The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts , for example , reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston , Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded .
The purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October , although it remains below 50 % .
A reading below 50 % indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding .
Mr. Lieberman said 0 the diverse showing in yesterday 's reports `` only enhances the importance of the employment data . ''
The employment report , which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices , is due out tomorrow .
The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October .
The economists forecast a 0.1 % rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 % .
Treasury Securities
In a surprise announcement , the Treasury said 0 it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week 's quarterly refunding of the federal debt .
The Treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by  selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three-year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10-year notes .
But rather than sell new 30-year bonds , the Treasury will issue $ 10 billion of 29year , nine-month bonds --  essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold  at the previous refunding in August .
Credit market analysts said 0 the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the 8 1\/8 % bond due August 2019 , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount .
Some dealers said 0 the Treasury 's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur .
The Treasury said 0 the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .
Until such action takes places , the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind .
Meanwhile , Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading .
The benchmark 30-year bond about 1\/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The benchmark was priced  at 102 22\/32  to yield 7.88 % compared with 102 12\/32 to yield 7.90 % Tuesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 100 22\/32  to yield 7.88 % compared with 100 16\/32 to yield 7.90 % .
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79 % , while the rate on six-month bills was slightly lower at 7.52 % compared with 7.60 % Tuesday .
Corporate Issues
IBM 's $ 750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market .
Meanwhile , most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1\/8 point higher .
In its latest compilation of performance statistics , Moody 's Investors Service found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7 % in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5 % .
Moody 's said 0 those returns compare with a 3.8 % total return for longer-term Treasury notes and bonds .
Total return measures price changes and interest income .
For the year to date , Moody 's said 0 total returns were topped  by the 16.5 % of longer-term Treasury issues ,  closely followed  by 15 % for investment-grade bonds .
Junk bonds trailed the group again .
`` Even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds , '' wrote Moody 's economist John Lonski in yesterday 's market report .
`` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found  wanting , '' he said .
Moody 's said 0 the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2 % in October .
Mortgage-Backed Issues
Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market .
Ginnie Mae 's 9 % issue for November delivery finished at 98 5\/8 , up 2\/32 , and its 9 1\/2 % issue at 100 22\/32 , also up 2\/32 .
The Ginnie Mae 9 % securities were yielding 9.32 % to a 12-year average life .
Activity was light in derivative markets , with no new issues priced  .
Municipal Issues
Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to up 1\/8 point in light , cautious trading prior to tomorrow 's unemployment report .
A $ 114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority was temporarily withdrawn  after  being tentatively priced  by a First Boston Corp. group .
An official for the lead underwriter declined  to comment on the reason for the delay , but market participants speculated that a number of factors , including a lack of investor interest , were responsible .
The issue could be relaunched  , possibly in a restructured form , as early as next week , according to the lead underwriter .
A $ 107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency , Calif. , tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced  at lower levels today , according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
The Santa Ana bonds were tentatively priced   to yield from 6.40 % in 1991 to 7.458 % in
 Bucking the market trend , an issue of $ 130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from Detroit , Mich. , apparently drew solid investor interest .
They were tentatively priced   to yield from 6.20 % in 1991 to 7.272 % in
Foreign Bond
West German dealers said 0 there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday 's new government bond issue .
So far , they said 0 , investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7 % .
It is generally expected  to be the usual 10-year , four billion mark issue .
Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue , or that the last Bund , a 7 % issue due October 1999 , would be increased  by two billion marks .
Elsewhere :
-- In Japan , the benchmark No. 111 4.6 % issue due 1998 ended on brokers screens unchanged at 95.09  to yield 5.435 % .

The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC 's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd .
The department said 0 it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase 's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires .
BTR PLC , a U.K. industrial conglomerate , said in June 0 it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd. , a U.K. unit of the tire maker , for # 140 million -LRB- $ 221.4 million -RRB- .
Michelin Tyre is a unit of France 's Michelin S.A .
Michelin officials could n't immediately comment on the referral , but they noted 0 the purchase from BTR has already been concluded  .
National Tyre , which has 420 branches throughout the U.K. , had 1988 pretax profit of # 8.5 million .
Rep. John Dingell , an important sponsor of President Bush 's clean-air bill , plans  to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue : acid rain .
The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is expected  today , is described  by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain .
The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $ 4 billion a year .
The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean-air legislation .
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation .
People close to the utility industry said 0 Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears  to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered  later .
Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises  to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 .
Although final details were n't available , sources said 0 the Dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions .
That proposal had been hailed  by environmentalists but despised  by utilities because they feared 0 it would limit their growth .
It also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters .
In addition , it is believed  to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help  subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country ,  sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills .
The administration ,  sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing .
Mr. Dingell 's staff was expected  to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing .
It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid-rain plan .
While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels .
Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House  to devise ways 0 to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns .
American City Business Journals Inc. said 0 its president , Michael K. Russell , will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte , N.C .
Mr. Russell , who co-founded the Kansas City , Mo.-based local business publications concern here , said 0 he would have a five-year consulting agreement with the company , which recently underwent an ownership change .
Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc. , Charlotte , acquired 30 % of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25 % from E.W. Scripps Co. next year .
Ray Shaw , chairman of American City , said 0 he would assume Mr. Russell 's responsibilities if a successor is n't found  this month .

Several moves were taken  following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility .
On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put  into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points .
The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , S&P 500 futures are not allowed  to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an hour .
If , when trading resumes , the S&P futures fall 30 points from the previous day 's close , a one-hour trading halt takes effect .
Also , the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points , and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day .
DOT System -- The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched  by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976 , to offer automatic , high-speed order processing .
A faster version , the SuperDot , was launched  in 1984 .
 Used  by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange , SuperDot handles about 80 % of all orders entered at the exchange .
Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy -LRB- for those who have purchased a contract -RRB- or deliver -LRB- for those who sold one -RRB- a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date .
Most contracts are simply nullified  by an opposite trade before they come due .
Indexing -- Many investors , mainly institutions , follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks 0 to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500 .
Many institutional index funds are active program traders ,  swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so .
Program trading -- A wide range of computer-assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks .
Quant -- Generally , any Wall Street analyst who employs quantitive research techniques .
The newest breed , also called `` rocket scientists '' because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics , devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known  as program trading .
Stock-index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time  executing offsetting trades in stock-index futures or options .
Traders profit by  trying  to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options .
If stocks are temporarily `` cheaper '' than futures , for example , an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures .
Stock-index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date .
The cash value is determined  by multiplying the index number by a specified amount .
The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor 's 500-stock index -LRB- traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -RRB- ; the Major Market Index , a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average -LRB- traded on the chicago Board of Trade -RRB- ; and the S&P 100 options -LRB- traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500 -RRB- .
Stock-index options -- Options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy -LRB- a call -RRB- or sell -LRB- a put -RRB- a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price , known as the strike price .
For stock indexes , the underlying investment may be a stock-index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index .
For example , there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index .
Uptick -- An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security .
New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15 % of United Airlines ' parent , UAL Corp. ,  saying 0 he might seek control of the nation 's second-largest airline .
Although takeover experts said 0 they doubted 0 Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself , the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping  revive a failed labor-management bid .
Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control .
But some investors have used such filings  to boost the value of their stock holdings , which -- without  buying more stock -- they then sold .
Takeover stock traders were puzzled  by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it does n't mean 0 Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control .
`` Maybe he just wants  to make something happen , '' said one takeover expert .
One investment banker said 0 Mr. Steinberg may be trying  to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid .
Mr. Steinberg , he suggested 0 , could replace British Airways PLC , which has withdrawn from the buy-out group .
Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without  making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out .
Reliance acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share .
Market sources said 0 Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock .
But the exact amount of Reliance 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed  .
The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board 's decision last week to remain independent .
Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $ 145 .
UAL 's announcement came after the market closed yesterday .
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , the shares closed at $ 177 , up $ 1.50 .
UAL would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified  of the filing by Reliance .
Reliance confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate .
Some takeover experts were skeptical ,  saying 0 it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only  to help  boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL .
Mr. Steinberg is thought  to be on friendly terms with UAL 's Mr. Wolf .
The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc .
Mr. Wolf 's success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987 .
But any potential acquirer must attempt  to reach some kind of accord with the company 's employees , primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists ' union , which has opposed a takeover .
A.L. Williams Corp. was merged  into Primerica Corp. , New York , after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction , the companies said 0 .
Primerica , which had owned nearly 70 % of Williams , will pay about 16.7 million shares , currently valued at almost $ 472 million , for the rest of Williams .
The financial-services company will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share .
Williams shares , which were  to be delisted  from the New York Stock Exchange after the close of composite trading yesterday , closed at $ 23.25 , off 12.5 cents .
Primerica closed at $ 28.25 , down 50 cents .
Williams , Duluth , Ga. , is an insurance and financial-services holding company .
Its subsidiaries ' services are marketed  by closely held A.L. Williams & Associates .
Primerica , as expected , also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities .
Terms were n't disclosed  .
Intelogic Trace Inc. , San Antonio , Texas , said 0 it bought 2.7 million shares , or about 18 % , of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $ 3.625 a share , or $ 9.9 million .
The move boosts Intelogic Chairman Asher Edelman 's stake to 20 % from 16.2 % and may help  prevent Martin Ackerman from  making a run at the computer-services concern .
Mr. Ackerman already is seeking  to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp. , an Intelogic affiliate .
The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives `` 0 to maximize shareholder value , '' including the possible sale of the company .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents  to close at $ 2.75 .
Mr. Edelman declined  to specify what prompted the recent moves ,  saying 0 they are meant only  to benefit shareholders when `` the company is on a roll . ''
He added , `` This has nothing 0 to do with Marty Ackerman and it is not designed , particularly ,  to take the company private . ''
But Mr. Ackerman said 0 the buy-back , and the above-market price paid , prove that Mr. Edelman is running  scared .
Dow Jones & Co. said 0 it extended its $ 18-a-share offer for Telerate Inc. common stock until 5 p.m. EST Nov. 9 .

Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal , Barron 's magazine , and community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases .
Rockwell International Corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
The aerospace , automotive supply , electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough .
In an interview , Donald Beall , chairman , said 0 first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets .
Still , he added 0 , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , Rockwell should be able  to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million .
For fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , Rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents a share .
That compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents a share , the year earlier .
The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents a share .
Sales rose 4 % to $ 3.28 billion from $ 3.16 billion .
Mr. Beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company 's electronics segment .
Overall , pretax electronics earnings soared 12 % to $ 107.9 million from $ 96.4 million .
All four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 .
For the year , electronics emerged as Rockwell 's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings ,  muscling out aerospace for the first time .
The graphics business , which also was singled out  by the chairman as a positive , saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79 % to $ 42.1 million from $ 23.5 million .
For the year ,  bolstered  by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press , graphics earnings almost doubled .
Aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower B-1B program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 .
That was partially offset  by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines .
The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship , according to analysts .
For fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87 a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04 a share , in fiscal 1988 .
Excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 .
Sales for the year rose 5 % to $ 12.52 billion from $ 11.95 billion in fiscal 1988 .
Dell Computer Corp. said 0 it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5 % to 17 % .
The Austin , Texas-based company , which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories , said 0 its price cuts include a $ 100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory , a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor .
That package now sells for about $ 2,099 .
A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor , with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $ 5,699 , down from $ 6,799 .
Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors , which the Dell models use , generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen .
World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil , a major grower and exporter , might not ship sugar this crop year and next .
Prices also were boosted  by another rumor that Mexico , usually a large producer and exporter , might have  to buy a large quantity of sugar .
Although traders rushed  to buy futures contracts , many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development , which could n't be confirmed  , analysts said 0 .
The March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day .
The March delivery , which has no limits , settled at 14.53 cents , up 0.56 cent a pound .
The May contract , which also is without restraints , ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents .
The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents , while other contract months showed near-limit advances .
According to reports carried by various news services , the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed  to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season , which began May 1 , and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used  to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .
One analyst , Arthur Stevenson , of Prudential-Bache Securities , New York , estimated that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline .
`` This is a demand that must be met  , regardless of the price of oil , '' said Mr. Stevenson .
Brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world .
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected  , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift 0 than had been anticipated  .
During the current crop year , Brazil was expected  to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar , a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89 .
Its 1989-90 exports were expected  to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in
`` It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year , '' explained Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
`` Producers were granted  the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected  to have begun  to be issued  '' yesterday .
As a result , Ms. Ganes said 0 , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped  yet , even though the crop year is six months old .
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes .
Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used  for cane , and this change is being felt  now , she said 0 .
Most important , Ms. Ganes noted 0 , `` Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made  on the suspension of exports . ''
Thomas Oxnard , sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack , N.J. , said : `` I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound . ''
Above all , Mr. Oxnard noted 0 , the situation is extremely confused .
`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable  to confirm the reports or get enough information 0 to clarify the situation , '' he said .
`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out  , such as the one saying 0 exports will be suspended  , and no one can confirm it . ''
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated .
On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago  to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
`` It has  to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar 0 it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said .
Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said 0 .
Last year , it had  to buy sugar on the world market  to meet export commitments , they noted 0 .
This year it is expected  to be a net importer and is said  to be seeking  to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar  to meet internal needs , analysts said 0 .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY :
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents  to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .
But the strength in heating oil helped  push up crude oil .
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel  to settle at $ 20.07 .
The firmness in heating oil was attributed  to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued  to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices 0 to come .
Trading was muted  in part because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain  to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
Traders said 0 prices also were supported  by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. .
That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain .
The Soviets are widely believed  to need additional supplies , despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October .
COPPER :
Futures prices rose ,  extending Tuesday 's gains .
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 .
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said 0 .
According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits .
However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said 0 .
Separately , Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament  to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months .
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea .
The parent of Younkers , after  failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores , said 0 it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps  to reduce its investment in retailing .
Equitable of Iowa Cos. , Des Moines , had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June , when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business .
But Equitable said 0 it was unable  to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million .
It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska .
Younkers management is likely  to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said 0 Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's president and chief executive officer .
He said 0 Equitable hopes  to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50 % .
Tony Lama Co. said that Equus Investment II Limited Partnership has proposed  changing the offer for the company to $ 13.65 in cash and stock from an all-cash transaction .
Under terms of the new proposal , Equus , managed by Equus Capital Corp. , Houston , would pay $ 12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $ 1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama 's 2.1 million shares outstanding .

Neither Equus nor Tony Lama gave a reason for the changed offer and Tony Lama could n't be reached  for comment .
However , Tony Lama said 0 it would promptly submit the offer to a special committee of the company 's board .

In a telephone interview , Mr. Reupke said 0 his departure was for `` personal reasons , '' which he declined  to specify .

`` If I were choosing the people of tomorrow , I would have chosen the people who are now on the board , '' he said .
A Reuters spokesman said 0 the departure reflects `` no change in strategy or profits . ''
Mark Shepperd , an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London , said , `` I suspect 0 -LRB- the departure -RRB- will be fairly irrelevant for the company .

A spokesman for the Stamford , Conn.based company said 0 operations had a loss of $ 5.5 million for the quarter ; in addition , the loss was magnified  by nonrecurring charges totaling $ 23.5 million and $ 8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as `` unusual . ''

An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6 % ; a reading above 50 % would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving .

`` This market 's still going through its pains , '' said Philip Puccio , head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities .
`` The psychology is still : ` We want -LRB- stocks -RRB- up , but if they do n't carry we 're going  to sell them . ' ''
Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market , also contributed to its lack of direction , Mr. Puccio said 0 .
Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined  largely to a round of buy programs near the close , which helped  offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips .
Trading is expected  to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates .

She said 0 the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $ 4 million 0 to be spread  over the next three quarters .

Junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation , a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor .
All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , who built the $ 12.7 billion Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield junk bonds .
Bears have targeted Columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market .
And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes .
Columbia stock recently hit 4 1\/8 , after reaching 11 3\/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private .
Moreover , junk professionals think Columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough , meaning 0 another markdown could be coming .
But in recent days , Columbia has edged up ,  closing at 5 1\/4 , up 3\/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure .
Mr. Spiegel 's fans say 0 Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets .
That 's almost $ 10 of equity for each Columbia share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion .
Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands .
The Spiegel family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes .
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner 's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though the latter cut its stake this summer .
While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say 0 Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan 0 to mitigate Columbia 's junk problems .
Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters 0 they were interested in creating a separate unit 0 to hold Columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .
Columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation .
But like other thrifts , it 's expected  to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity .
Plans to do this are due to be filed  in a week or so .
New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years .
That 's why Columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right .
Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo n't provide current data on its junk .
But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered  .
These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value .
Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated 0 it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .
It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings .
One trial balloon 0 Mr. Spiegel is said  to have floated to investors : Columbia might be broken up  , as Mellon Bank was split  into a good bank and a bad bank .
But Columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments .
Some think 0 Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized  at , say $ 300 million , and shopped  to a commercial bank that wants a California presence .
The thrift surely could be sold  for more than the value of its equity , financial industry executives say 0 .
Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off  to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who might then have a new career , investors say 0 .
It is n't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders .
But `` the concept is workable .
You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds  to capitalize the bad bank , '' says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York .
Mr. Spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street .
Few people think 0 Mr. Spiegel wants  to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force Columbia to become .
`` They are n't really a thrift , '' says Jonathan Gray , a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst .
Of course , regulators would have  to approve Columbia 's reorganization .
And some investment bankers say 0 a restructuring is n't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel 's past junk-bond trades .

Genetics Institute Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said 0 it was awarded  U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein .
The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology .
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it .
Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment , bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders , Genetics Institute said 0 .
The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1 , a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage .
The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects , Genetics Institute said 0 .
The company added that it has filed patent applications `` on a large number of different BMP proteins '' and the patent on BMP-1 is the first 0 it has received .
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers , the company said 0 .
The Bush administration 's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified . ''
People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will vote on the nomination , said 0 some liberal members of the panel are likely  to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter .
Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court .
Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies .
Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said 0 they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment -LCB- and -RCB- respect for the law . ''
A senior Justice Department official , however , said 0 the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating .
`` We 're pleased 0 the ABA rated him qualified , '' David Runkel , the department 's chief spokesman , said in an interview .
The ABA gives a `` qualified '' rating to nominees 0 it believes 0 would perform `` satisfactorily '' on the bench .
In contrast , the lawyers ' association gives a `` well qualified '' rating to those `` regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy .
Metallgesellschaft AG said 0 it agreed  to acquire 51 % of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation .
Terms were n't disclosed  .
Metallgesellschaft , a diversified Frankfurt , West Germany-based metals group , said 0 it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company  to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants .
Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit , the company said 0 .
The move is part of a strategy 0 to focus on its core metals trading , processing and plant engineering activities while  shedding peripheral units , the company said 0 .
Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks -LRB- $ 434.4 million -RRB- and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks .
The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock .
A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset  by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry .
Because of the rulings , the Commerce Department will continue  to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act .
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market .
ITC officials said 0 final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .
If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .
Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $ 405 million from Taiwan , $ 400 million from South Korea and $ 125 million from Hong Kong , according to the ITC .
In another action , the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington , Del. , against imports of neoprene , a type of synthetic rubber , from France and West Germany .
These imports totaled about $ 17 million last year .
Upjohn Co. said 0 it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge .
Upjohn officials said 0 they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , will participate in the retirement plan .
But the pharmaceutical company said 0 it `` anticipates 0 the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs . ''
The program , available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older , could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 % .
In addition , Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay .
Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy 0 to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program . ''
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up  being eliminated  .
`` It 's a cosmetic move , '' said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co .
According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan .
Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced  .
As a result , Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece .
An Upjohn spokesman said 0 he had `` heard nothing '' 0 to suggest 0 the early retirement package was spurred  by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation .
The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan  to ward off unwanted suitors .
The spokesman said 0 it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy .
Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman said 0 .
INTER-TEL Inc . -LRB- Chandler , Ariz. -RRB- --
Jerry Chapman , managing director of WayMar Associates , was elected  a director of this business telecommunications software and systems concern .
He increases the board to seven .
`` Feeding Frenzy '' -LRB- Henry Holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note .
Right up front in the preface , co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity .
When  offered  a free trip from the Bronx , Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , by one of Wedtech 's principals , he tells the reader , ``  mindful of accepting anything of value from those 0 I was writing about , I declined . ''
Any question as to why an author would believe 0 this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered  by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .
Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path 0 Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy .
The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation .
Although  started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get  rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- minority business program .
This is a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that mandates 0 certain government contracts be awarded  noncompetitively to minority businesses .
Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born  in Puerto Rico .
The two partners merely had  to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .
Instead of 50\/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .
Besides  being a `` minority-owned company '' Wedtech was located  in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept  using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .
 Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi -LRB- now serving a jail sentence -RRB- , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese .
Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling ,  retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .
When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .
Wedtech management used the merit system .
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .
If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person .
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading .
None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .
The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .
Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .
He enters the story toward the end , just in time 0 to get  arrested  .
 Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place .
They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want  to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''
Programs like Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by  to scoop it up .
Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech .
They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption .
Why are programs like this not eliminated  ?
`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described  as  belonging to a political insider commercial party .
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money 0 to be made  in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .
They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .
How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .
Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983-85 .
The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle  to form a new company  to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships .
The new company will attempt  to limit the shipyard 's losses , participants said 0 .
`` The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business .
Everything will be taken over  by the new company , '' said Christian Andersson , executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae , former parent of Waertsilae Marine .
Once its ownership is finalized  , the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers 0 to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities .
Subcontractors will be offered  a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected  to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said 0 .
Under an accord signed yesterday , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa -LRB- $ 23.5 million -RRB- .
Oy Waertsilae is  to contribute 200 million markkaa , most of it as subordinated debt , and take a minority stake in the new company .
Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine 's undelivered ships are expected  to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital , government officials said 0 .
Waertsilae Marine 's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc .
Carnival , which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine , presented claims for $ 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week .
Waertsilae Marine 's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court .
Its plans to be acquired  dashed  , Comprehensive Care Corp. said 0 it plans  to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets  to pay its debt and provide working capital .
In all , the company hopes  to repay $ 45 million in debt through the sales , which will completely discharge its secured debt , the company said 0 .
In addition , the company has replaced its president and chief executive ,  naming W. James Nichol , head of the company 's contract health services , to succeed B. Lee Karns .
Mr. Nichol said 0 he was `` extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company 's operations while it attempted  to conclude the reorganization during the past four months . ''
Concurrent with Mr. Nichol 's appointment , Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine , Calif. , to St. Louis , where the company maintained its contract services offices .
Mr. Karns continues as chairman .
Comprehensive Care had agreed  to be acquired  by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk , Va. , but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Comprehensive Care closed at $ 3.75 a share , up 12.5 cents .
Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47 % decline in fourth-quarter earnings , reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market .
The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million , or 65 cents a share , compared with $ 84.9 million , or $ 1.24 a share , a year earlier .
Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion .
For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share .
This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations .
Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion .
Ralston said 0 its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company .
The battery plant , which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed  over the next year or so , a spokesman said 0 .
Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , which required higher advertising spending .
For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said 0 .
Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion .
The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added 0 .
Ralston said 0 its Eveready battery unit was hurt  by continuing economic problems in South America .
Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.50 , off $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .

The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline .
The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling  to find enough river barges and trains 0 to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships .
River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier .
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge  to find enough of the crop 0 to meet their obligations to the Soviets .
The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. .
The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered  by January , which would be a strain in most years .
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped  overseas .
`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert .
`` It is going  to be real tight . ''
Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges 0 their tows push at one time .
In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able  to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning  to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which feeds into the Mississippi River .
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it .
Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation .
But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue  falling this month .
At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed  , an Army Corps spokesman said 0 .
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .
So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade .
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there  to calculate the price 0 they offer  to buy corn from farmers .
At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel  to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel .
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .
With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try  to gather the corn 0 they are obligated  to deliver .
Farmers are in the best position of many years 0 to push up corn prices .
Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .
In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn .
Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said 0 Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa .
It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game .
Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin  buying corn futures contracts --  only to see little appreciation .
`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain 0 to be shipped  , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .
Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by  shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port .
Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans .
One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore .
And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace .
The Soviet orders were compressed  into the month of October because of delays .
The Soviet Union usually begins  buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall .
But its purchases apparently were delayed  by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged  in a fire , tightening an already tight European market .
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel .
Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday .
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets .
December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 .
January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 .
Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced  more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York .
`` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said .
Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said 0 .
Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said 0 .
Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , he said 0 .
Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman .
COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted  to strike .
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 .
In Chile , workers at two copper mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada , yesterday voted  to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said 0 .
Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said 0 , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike .
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks .
In the case of copper , he said 0 , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected  in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal .
Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted 0 , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold .
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .
The September index was 47.1 % .
A reading below 50 % generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above 50 % points to expansion .
The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50 % .
NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software 0 to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers .
The new software is based  on Novell Inc. 's NetWare network operating system software .
USX Corp. posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed  to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations .
The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million , or 62 cents a share , compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80 cents a share .
The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset sales , while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ 61 million .
In the 1988 period , USX also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement .
Sales rose 5 % to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.2 billion .
The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing .
However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .
Among segments that continue  to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued  to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets .
Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results .
Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .
The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd .
In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million .
Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said 0 .
Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers ,  earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit plummeted 70 % .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales .
The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' .
Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said 0 USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved  in labor contracts earlier this year .
He said 0 USX also appeared  to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .
The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest .
Higher crude oil prices helped  boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million .
The Texas Oil & Gas division continues  to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million .
USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves .
Proceeds of that sale are  to be used  to reduce debt and buy back shares .
The company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987 .
USX has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding .
The announced sale of the reserves was followed  by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination .
Mr. Icahn has said 0 he believes 0 USX would be worth more if  broken up  into steel and energy segments .
Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
Sales rose 10 % to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .

DiLoreto , president of metal container division , was named  to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern ,  succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named  president and chief operating officer in August .
Two leading constitutional-law experts said 0 President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto .
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said 0 any effort by President Bush 0 to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without  having  to scuttle the entire measure .
Mr. Bush has said 0 he would like  to be able  to use this procedure .
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering  declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto  to provoke a test case .
But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . ''
The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
The two professors said 0 the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
Moreover , they said 0 the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation 0 to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
Trinity Industries Inc. said 0 it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago .
